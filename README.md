## Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing Data Relationships and Correlations
In this project, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset and focus on visualizing data relationships and correlations between different features. Our goal is to gain valuable insights from the data, understand the underlying patterns, and make informed decisions for further analysis or modeling.

# Issues to Address:
# Issue 1:
Task: Plot a heatmap to analyze data relationships and correlations.

# Issue 2:
Task: Create a histogram for the "chol" (Cholesterol) feature.

# Issue 3:
Task: Create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between "age" and "trestbps" (Resting Blood Pressure).

# Issue 4:
Task: Create a box plot to compare the distribution of "trestbps" for each "target" class.

# Issue 5:
Task: Create a box plot to compare the distribution of "age" for each "sex" and the "target" class.

# Issue 6:
Task: Create a bar plot to visualize the distribution of the "cp" (Chest Pain Type) feature.

# Issue 7:
Task: Create a bar plot to compare the distribution of "sex" for each "target" class.

By addressing these issues and visualizing the data relationships and correlations, we will have a better understanding of the dataset, which will be invaluable for our data exploration and analysis process. Let's proceed with the tasks and create insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and insights from the data.
